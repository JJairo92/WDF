		<h1>Websites I Validated</h1>		
		<h2><em>Kingdom Hearts Insider</em></h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.khinsider.com/" title="Link to Kingdom Heart Insider's Home Page" target="_blank">www.khinsider.com</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Website didn't pass validation in both of the HTML validators</p>
		
		<h3>HTML Lint Validator</h3>
		<p>In the HTML Lint Validator there was one error; an illegal closing tag.</p> <p>&lt;&sol;p&gt; was used instead of &lt;&sol;div&gt;</p>
		<p>The developer should just switch the &lt;&sol;p&gt; closing tag to &lt;&sol;div&gt;</p>
		
		<h3>nu Validator</h3>
		<p>In the nu Validator there were 103 errors; these include warnings and errors.</p>
		<p>Some of the errors included XML attributes not allowed in HTML, element img required the alt attribute, the ampersand was used in an URL.</p>
		<p>XML attributes should not be used, they can be taken out and replaced with HTML attributes. Also, the alt attribute should be added to the img elements, finally &amp; entity should be used instead of the actual ampersand.</p>
		
		<h2><em>League of Legends</em></h2>
		<ul>

		<h3>HTML Lint Validator</h3>
		<p>In the HTML Lint Validator there were 11 errors; they were all about not closing empty tags.</p>
		<p>There were no closing tags for 10 img empty tags, and for one hr empty tag.</p>

		<p>Some of the errors included element img required the alt attribute, the element h2 is not allowed as a child of the span element, the element style is not allowed as a child of div element.</p>
