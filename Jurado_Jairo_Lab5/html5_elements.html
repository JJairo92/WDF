				<h2>Main Information</h2>

It is the sequel to 2009's Borderlands and was released for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and OS X platforms. As with the first game, <mark>Borderlands 2</mark> players complete a campaign consisting of central quests and optional side-missions as one of four treasure seekers, "Vault Hunters", on the planet Pandora. Key gameplay features from the original game, such as online collaborative campaign gameplay; randomly generated loot, such as weapons and shields; and character-building elements commonly found in role-playing video games are found in <mark>Borderlands 2</mark>. The game was released to critical acclaim on September 18, 2012. Downloadable content for the game has also been released.</p>

				<h2>Gameplay</h2>
				<hr />
				<p><mark>Borderlands 2</mark> builds upon the gameplay elements introduced in its predecessor, Borderlands. It is a first-person shooter that includes elements found in role-playing games, leading Gearbox to call the game a "role-playing shooter." At the start of the game, players select one of four new characters, each with a unique special skill and proficiencies with certain weapons. After this, players take on quests assigned through non-player characters or bounty boards, each typically rewarding the player with experience points, money, and sometimes a reward item. Players earn experience by eliminating foes and completing in-game challenges (such as getting a certain number of kills using a specific type of weapon). As they gain levels from experience growth, players can then put skill points into a skill tree that features three distinct specializations of the base character. As with the first game, <mark>Borderlands 2</mark> features a procedural-generated loot system, whereby weapons and other equipment dropped by foes, found in chests, or offered as quest items have numerous statistics that are generated randomly, affecting factors such as weapon damage, accuracy, magazine size, and added effects like elemental damage. Randy Pitchford, noting that the procedural system in the first game generated 17.75 million possible guns, claimed that the variation in <mark>Borderlands 2</mark> is much larger.</p>

				<p>Returning gameplay features from the first game will include the 3-branch skill tree, class-mods, and four-player online cooperative modes. New features include a more expansive and customizable weapons system, reworked four-seat drift-able vehicles and vehicle physics elements.</p>

				<p>In addition, the <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> system has been reworked for the game. Non-enemies will populate the game world more often and will travel around different locations depending on the time. According to Gearbox <abbr title="Vice President">VP</abbr> Steve Gibson, enemy AI will encourage teamwork, such as flanking, as well as taking cover when wounded, though lower level enemies like Psychos will still embrace the mentality of <i>"Wow that's a gun! I want my face in front of it!"</i>. Shooting enemies will stun or cripple them depending on where they are shot, such as shooting a Hyperion robot's arms will cause the arms to fall off, impairing its damage-dealing capabilities. For a change, enemies will be intelligent enough to climb and traverse difficult terrain to pursue the player. Enemies will also be able to interact with each other. For example, certain enemies can heal their teammates, boost their shields for defense, or use them as shields to protect themselves.</p>

				<h2>Synopsis</h2>
				<hr />
				<h3>Setting</h3>
				<p>Five years have passed since the events of Borderlands, when four Vault Hunters, a Hunter, a Soldier, a Siren and a Berserker, were guided by a mysterious entity known as "The Guardian Angel" to the Vault and confronted an alien abomination known as "The Destroyer". After defeating The Destroyer, a valuable mineral called "Eridium" started flourishing through Pandora's crust. Handsome Jack, a member of the Hyperion Corporation, secures this new resource and makes use of it to take over the corporation. Now, Handsome Jack rules over the inhabitants of Pandora with an iron fist from his massive satellite built in the shape of an "H", always visible in the sky in front of Pandora's moon. Meanwhile, rumors of an even larger Vault hidden on Pandora spread across the universe, drawing a new group of Vault Hunters to the planet in search for it.</p>

				<h3>Characters</h3>
				<p>Like its predecessor, <mark>Borderlands 2</mark> initially features four playable characters. New to <mark>Borderlands 2</mark>, however, are two new characters available as downloadable content.</p>

				<p>The <b>first</b> character, Salvador, is a "Gunzerker", who resembles Brick from the first game in abilities, but instead of using massive melee power to decimate enemies, Salvador can dual-wield any combination of guns. His skills can be upgraded so that he can throw multiple grenades at once, regenerate massive amounts of health and ammunition, or attract the attention of enemies with a double middle finger taunt.</p>

				<p>The <b>second</b> character, a siren named Maya, has an ability called Phaselock which suspends and immobilizes enemies in midair and resembles Lilith from the first game in abilities. Her abilities revolve around the game's elements (fire, electricity, corrosion, and slag.) Her Phaselock can be upgraded to create a fiery explosion upon engaging or even convert enemies into temporary allies.</p>

				<p>The <b>third</b> character, Axton, is a commando character who relies on turrets to decimate his enemies and resembles Roland in abilities. Most of his abilities are geared towards upgrading his turret. Axton's turret can be armed with additional gun barrels, can detonate upon deployment, or stick to walls and ceilings. One particular skill tree allows two of the turrets to be deployed at once.</p>

				<p>The <b>fourth</b> character, Zer0, is an assassin capable of creating a decoy of himself and becoming invisible for a short time. At the end of this process, he is then able to unleash a critical hit on an enemy with his sword or gun. He is skilled with sniper rifles and melee attacks, and is similar to Mordecai, one of the playable characters from the original Borderlands. His skills can be upgraded with emphasis on sniping, gaining additional benefits when using his Deception ability or improving his melee attacks.</p>

				<p>A <b>fifth</b> playable character (available as a downloadable content), Gaige, is a red-haired cyborg girl and a "Mechromancer" who can summon a D374-TP "Deathtrap" â€“ a hulking, floating machine made of scrap parts, originally designed to be a "bully deterrent". Her skills upgrades can be used for wide array of attacks for her Deathtrap (having a mounted laser or performing an Explosive Clap for close-ranged enemies); or having her shots bounce any surface and hit their target or increase in damage after consecutive kills at the cost of accuracy.</p>

				<p>A <b>sixth</b> playable character named Krieg, released on May 14, 2013 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC, is primarily a melee character and modeled as a playable Psycho, using skill trees such as Bloodlust, Mania and Hellborn.</p>

				<p>The four player characters from the first game, Roland, Lilith, Brick, and Mordecai, all return in the form of NPCs that the new characters will encounter on Pandora, or in various missions. Non-playable characters like the Guardian Angel and Claptrap return to aid the player during quests. Characters from the first game such as Scooter the mechanic, Dr. Zed, and the insane archaeologist Patricia Tannis join new faces such as the cyborg Sir Hammerlock and Scooter's sister Ellie as quest giving characters.</p>
