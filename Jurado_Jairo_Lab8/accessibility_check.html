			<p>The website can be considered a résumé of Àlex Catalan, he's a web designer and developer. The website passed the Section 508 test and the only problem with the accessibility check was that he needed to nest the headers. He has h1, then, h3, and then h2. It Should be in numerical order.</p>

			</ul>
			
			<img src="images/graph.jpg" alt="Image of Graph Concepts&quot; Site" />
			
			<p>The website is for a company called <em>Graph Concepts</em>. They focus on web design, web development, visual identity design, graphic design, SEO, and online marketing. The website only had 1 issue during the Section 508 test was that the developer should specify the background color since the foreground color was specified. As far as the accessibility check goes, the only problems were to change the b tags to ems; also to keep headings in numerical order.</p>

		<h2>The Twelve</h2>

				<li><a href="http://www.todaythe12.com/" title="Link to The Twelve&apos;s Website" target="_blank">The Twelve Site</a></li>
			</ul>
			
			<img src="images/twelve.jpg" alt="Image of The Twelve&quot;s Site" />
			
			<p>The website is for a studio called <em>The Twelve</em>, they focus on art direction, video, graphic design, web, motion graphics, and 3D. The website had 2 issues with the Section 508 test, this was the same issue with the accessibility check test; they didn't include the alt attribute for any of the images. One more problem in the accessibility check occurred, to keep the headings in numerical order. The simplest way to fix it is to put the headings in numerical order and to add the alt attributes with a description or function of the image if it's an image with a link.</p>

		<h2>Wayne Rooney</h2>

			</ul>
			
			<img src="images/rooney.jpg" alt="Image of Official Wayne Rooney&quot;s Site" />
			
			<p>The website is of football &lpar;soccer&rpar; player Wayne Rooney. It has a gallery of photos, news, stats, etc. The website had 1 issue during the Section 508 test, the developer needs to include the alt attribute to images. As far as the accessibility check goes, the developer needs to fix the contrast colors; they need to have a contrast ration of 4.5:1 (don't know what that means but that's what the check results said).</p>
