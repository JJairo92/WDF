			<title>Districk 13: Ultimatum</title>

			<description>This movie was better than the first one since it had inspirational moments. The first movie had too much crime for my taste. In this movie however, they fought for the government to not destroy a city.</description>

			<title>The Matrix</title>

			<description>This movie was amazing, it explored so many beliefs and I think (not sure) what they tried to do was combine as many beliefs as possible. I like this movie mainly because regardless of the fact that it explored many beliefs, I feel like it focused on my belief subconsciously.</description>

			<description>This movie was hilarious! I could not stop laughing at the stupidity that happened pretty much throughout the whole movie. It tried to inspire at some moments but I think it was mainly all fun and games.</description>

			<title>Seeking a Friend for The End of the World</title>

			<description>This movie was very good. I mainly loved how it showed the different types of people and how they would most likely act if this was The End of the World was a real thing.</description>
